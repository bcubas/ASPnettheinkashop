    <h2>&nbsp;Reverse Mortgages</h2>
    <p>What are reverse Mortgages? Basically they are a loan for homeowners that are 62 years of age or older and have home equity that they can borrow against it. 
        The difference between this loan and a Home equity line of credit is that in a reverse mortgage, the borrower doesn&#39;t have to make any loan payments. 
        Instead, the entire loan balance becomes due when the borrower dies, moves away permanently or sells the house. The lender has to structure a loan that doesn&#39;t 
        exceed the value of the home due to market value or if the borrower lives longer. This loans are federally insured.</p>
